The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

The bulls are back on Wall Street, with good reason. The US and China have agreed to ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of meetings in Switzerland, the US will take reciprocal tariffs on China down to 10% from 125%. A separate tariff imposed by President Trump over what he says is China’s role in the fentanyl trade will stay intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. Stocks soared on the news, the US dollar caught a strong bid, and defensive plays such as gold sold off. Investors will now be looking for two things to keep the bullish vibes going: first, that the two economic superpowers signal there is an opportunity to take tariffs down even further after the 90-day pause; and second, that the tariffs aren’t hammering the US economy. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with eToro global markets analyst Lale Akoner on Opening Bid for perspective on whether stocks will be back for the rest of the year or if this is just a headfake.

Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives. Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy. ""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says. The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says. Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a new iPhone SE sometime this week, which could play a crucial role in the company’s smartphone business. The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. ""The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,"" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: ""This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.""

""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

Allspring Global Investments senior portfolio manager Bryant VanCronkhite joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss his top investment outlooks and share the biggest market risks for 2025. VanCronkhite warns of investor ""complacency"" in 2025, particularly regarding the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. While acknowledging their ""tremendous"" returns, he cautions, ""That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now."" He explains, ""We don't want to pay as much of a multiple for companies that are growing slower, which is the Mag Seven, compared to the broader market, which is the Russell 2000 (^RUT) and the Russell mid-cap stocks."" VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. ""That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Regarding sector opportunities, VanCronkhite expresses caution about the banking sector, describing it as ""nerve-racking"" despite market optimism. Instead, he points to materials and healthcare as sectors with attractive valuations that could outperform in 2025.

As the AI trade welcomes a variety of new participants and infrastructure components in 2025, Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin shares several of his Big Tech predictions for this year with Asking for a Trend's Josh Lipton. Bajarin names several of the typical players in the AI semiconductor space contributing to infrastructure, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL). ""A ton of growth still going on the infrastructure side, so I imagine that that that will continue,"" Bajarin states. ""We're going to continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for compute, that's not going away. But I think what I'm looking for in 2025 is the software monetization of those stocks."" Bajarin also weighs in on the reported boost in productivity from executives after deploying AI agents across several industries, as well as what is to be expected on cloud computing spend and Apple's (AAPL) AI-enabled computers and smart devices.

Mukunda asserts that companies are being pragmatic in their support for Trump, pointing out Trump's historical willingness to use federal government power against those he perceives as political enemies or threats.

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

Quantum computing stocks are in focus after Google unveiled its new quantum computing chip, Willow, which contributed to Alphabet stock's recent gains. D-Wave (QBTS), a quantum computing company, announced it secured $175 million in funding. CEO Alan Baratz joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to break down what's going on in the quantum computing space and what investors need to know about its connection to artificial intelligence (AI). ""There's a lot of synergy between AI and quantum,"" Baratz says, adding, ""The way I think about it is that there are three areas in which AI and quantum work together."" ""The first and most obvious is that each can work side by side to solve a problem synergistically. For example, you might use AI to predict product demand in the future and then use quantum computing to optimize the supply chain to meet that demand."" ""Second, we are doing a fair amount of work right now on how quantum computing could be used as part of the model training and inference for AI."" The CEO explains, ""Because of the fact that [quantum is] so much faster than classical [computing] and requires so much less power, we think that we may be able to support model training and inference with much lower power consumption than what's happening today, which could be a game-changer.""

Clinton says there are two things driving Apple stock higher. He explains, ""First of all, I think the Magnificent Seven in general, we've had a pretty good period really since the election. We got past sort of the uncertainty about direction right at the top level for the country."" ""The second piece is specific to Apple. If you look at their business, I think that the iPhone numbers, and investors seem to realize this, for next year, are kind of de-risked. I mean, expectations are low... There's really no expectation for AI adding much of anything to Apple over the next year."" On the reports of Apple working on a chip, Clinton says ""Any company that is playing in the AI space that has over $1 billion market cap, we think, they have to develop their own silicon. It's just a matter of time for any of those companies who aren't doing it. Apple was obviously always involved in making their own silicon for their devices. Now, they're bringing that into the server and doing it for their particular use case in AI.

Morningstar technology analyst William Kerwin joins Morning Brief to discuss the potential impact of the Trump administration on Big Tech companies. While Kerwin notes that ""a lot remains to be seen,"" he is focused on how Trump's trade policies could affect companies like Apple (AAPL) that have a presence in China. Kerwin believes these companies may seek to diversify their trade relationships to regions like India or Southeast Asia, stating ""it will be a trend across the sector."" However, he cautions that high China exposure does not necessarily equate to high investment risk, saying, ""You really have to unpack what's in that exposure."" Regarding regulatory impacts, Kerwin thinks ""there could still be some antitrust [action] against the largest of tech companies."" But he also expects ""M&A deals at the rung just below those largest of largest tech companies can start to pick up again over the next four years.""

Co-founded by CEO Michael Mager and neurosurgeon and engineer Ben Rapoport, Precision Neuroscience began in 2021 with three former employees of Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Precision Neuroscience is developing its version of an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) technology meant to help individuals with neurological disorders, such as ALS, to better function and communicate. Mager says Precision Neuroscience's technology is high-bandwidth, sits on ""the surface of the brain without doing any damage,"" and is reversible. In an interview with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram from the Yahoo Invest conference, Mager discusses the company's road ahead and potential market, what to expect from the upcoming Trump presidency, and a possible IPO. “We view brain computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation,” says Mager. “This is gonna have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas.” To see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts.

Mahoney tells retail investors, ""Don't get involved in this. You know there's a lot of emotion, and I know it's easy for me to say that, but the last thing you want to do is get whipsawed out of your position ... Our Founding Fathers kind of figured this out, that we have a balance of power and after this election, we're still going to have a balance of power."" He adds there are ""so many tailwinds,"" including the Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday, Big Tech companies' artificial intelligence (AI) spending, and strong earnings. ""You have a lot of bears [that have] been on the sidelines. They're going to have to commit capital toward the end of the year. Otherwise, the index is going to be way ahead of them. So again, I just say that sometimes we lose sight. We have to come back [and] see where we are, and there's a really strong tailwind despite who wins."" He highlights, ""Our favorites are still the market leaders"" like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). ""That's the way we've been playing this right now is some of your best stocks you like with the added volatility. Make volatility your friend, not your foe.

Portfolio Wealth Advisors president and CIO Lee Munson joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. Munson tells Yahoo Finance that Berkshire's growing cash pile reflects Warren Buffett's strategy to sell high, saying, ""I think you're going to have to see a market that trades much lower in valuation before you get him to do anything. And if he does anything that's not in a market that's getting crushed in its valuation, I think it's because he's going to look at things that he knows best or that are doing best and that's going to be in energy or in some of these industrial aerospace things that have been working well.""

He also monitors pre-election volatility's (^VIX) influence on Treasury yields (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX), and bitcoin's (BTC-USD) year-to-date pullback as it rallies ahead of the election and flirts with staying above its $70,000 benchmark.

2024-11-01 20:30:22,"Apple needs AI hype to drive upgrades but can't disappoint users. Apple's (AAPL) earnings bring Apple Intelligence into focus as the iPhone maker rolls out its artificial intelligence (AI) features, hoping to drive an accelerated device upgrade cycle. Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the ""unpredictability"" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. ""It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before."" ""I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers,"" he says, but notes that ""Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features."" The analyst says while Apple is ""in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software,"" he worries ""that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices.""

Apple (AAPL) may have beat fiscal fourth quarter revenue estimates with $94.9 billion (estimates were for $94.3 billion), but adjusted earnings fell far below Wall Street's expectations due to a one-time charge from a European General Court decision. While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. ""It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit,"" Forte says. ""So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing"" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a ""real risk"" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

Intel (INTC) saw its shares soar after the chip giant posted better-than-expected Q3 revenue and Q4 guidance. Apple (AAPL) also reported fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday.

This crucial data point will provide investors with fresh insights into potential monetary policy decisions.

Horizon Investments head of portfolio strategy Zachary Hill joins Julie Hyman and Josh Schafer on Market Domination to break down what investors need to know with Big Tech earnings and fresh economic data on deck in the final week before the US presidential election. “The next two weeks are like the Super Bowl for investors, just one after another, after another,” Hill tells Yahoo Finance. Next week, five of the “Magnificent Seven” names — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL) — are reporting quarterly earnings. “That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC),” the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the “debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months.” On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher. “There's a lot of reasons to worry,” like rates staying higher for longer and the election, among other factors, but “really when we cut through a lot of that noise, we focus on the primarily on the health of the underlying economy, because that's going to drive earnings and ultimately that's going to dictate the path for risk assets. We still see that, broadly speaking, as being something that's that's very supportive.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

Calamos Investments senior vice president and head of ETFs Matt Kaufman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss investing strategies. Kaufman points out that the Magnificent Seven trade continues to drive strong market returns, with the group up 40% this year. He notes, ""The Mag Seven is still accounting for a significant portion"" of market gains, even as the other 493 S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies are starting to gain momentum. ""If the leadership in the Mag 7 stops continuing going forward, maybe the innovation doesn't keep up at the same pace, then you would want exposure to those other names as well,"" Kaufman advises. He suggests investors consider CANQ (CANQ), an ETF that provides exposure to top names using options to remain defensive. ""We're seeing a lot of folks moving into this options-based strategy, which really allows you to control the exposure you want to these Mag 7 names and to others,"" Kaufman explains.

2024-10-08 21:19:08,"We're starting to see return on AI investments: Portfolio manager. Most Magnificent Seven tech stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, and the tech sector is attempting a recovery from a lackluster third quarter. The Magnificent Seven is currently comprised of Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Market Domination to discuss how investors can best play the tech sector. Many investors were disappointed during the second quarter earnings season as they looked for significant returns on their AI plays. Rizzo expects this theme to also prevail over the upcoming tech earnings season. However, he argues, ""when I look at the return on investment for the hyperscalers and for the entire technology sector, I actually think we're starting to see it."" He points to Meta Platforms (META) as an example, explaining, ""At one point during the year, people thought that Meta would have Q4 growth rates in the mid-single digits. Now, that number is closer to 20%. And why is that? That's because they've been able to use AI to get a lot better targeting in their core advertising business."" He also believes that Apple (AAPL) will see the beginning of an upgrade cycle as it offers AI capabilities on its iPhone 16 series. In addition, he argues that Nvidia (NVDA) is in the best position as the company is ""selling the linchpin technology to all of these vendors."" While the Magnificent Seven has been under pressure, Rizzo tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think the divergence that we've seen amongst the Magnificent Seven, and between the Mag Seven and the S&P 493, is really quite natural."" Rizzo notes that the Magnificent Seven has historically grown earnings at a rate of 50 to 100% faster than the rest of the S&P 500. He expects that to continue over the medium term, especially as many of the Magnificent Seven players are well-positioned for AI. However, at this moment, he explains that they are trading only at a 50% premium to the rest of the market, making them cheaper based on a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. He finds AI will continue to drive innovation and push further growth in mega-cap tech names. With this dynamic at play, Rizzo expects the AI chip market to grow to $400 billion by 2027.

As the Nasdaq (^IXIC) is down the most out of the three major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC), investors may be wondering if now is the time to buy on the dip. Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. “We have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,” Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, “We are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.” The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners “used more indirect exposure than direct buying,” with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “that have significant weighting to these names.” He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were ""within the context of also adding to things like"" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). ""I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.” Browne also has focused on ""standouts within leading sectors."" He says ""Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.""

2024-09-27 21:07:13,"Apple still AI winner despite iPhone 16 reception: Analyst. Apple's (AAPL) new iPhone 16 has received mixed reception. Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down why he’s concerned about the iPhone maker in the near term despite expecting the company to be a major benefactor of artificial intelligence (AI). “We're concerned about the upcoming cycle for a number of reasons,” Chkaiban says. “There are early data points suggesting that iPhone 16 reception is poor. Users are often disappointed. They see limited innovation. He adds that Apple Intelligence being delayed until after the initial launch of the device “doesn't really help.” Among the other factors contributing to Apple’s near-term headwinds are shortening refresh cycles as “iPhone users hold onto their devices for longer” and increased competition in China. Another concern is a general weakness in consumer demand. Chkaiban projects Apple will ship 215 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, which is 10% below consensus estimates. Despite near-term concerns, the analyst says Apple is in a prime position in the AI era. He explains, “The generative AI iPhone revolution indeed won't be hardware-driven. It will happen over multiple cycles. It won't create a near-term product cycle, but it will still revolutionize the user experience over time and I do believe that Apple is very well positioned to capture some value as they control a large ecosystem of high-end devices.” “Over coming years, I think Apple can do well with generative AI, with Apple intelligence getting rolled out. But it's not going to drive a near-term product cycle. That's what we're concerned about.” He expects that Apple’s revenue will grow, but this growth will be driven by services rather than device sales. “Bottom line is Apple can probably grow revenues mid to high single digits and earnings between low-to-mid teens. And so yes, over the long run, I think Apple is definitely a good name to own. And if there is indeed a pullback related to weakness in the current cycle, that would probably create a good entry point.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance that there are some “fundamental challenges” right now in Apple's push for a device upgrade cycle, affirming that he is still a big believer in AI in the long run. As for the smartphone business overall?

On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading week. US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened in negative territory, just one morning after the market rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched new record highs. John Hancock investment management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland explains, “It's six straight days of gains leading markets higher [and] riskier assets are really celebrating this idea that the Fed can stave off a hard landing, prevent a contraction from happening, do it proactively before we see more weakness here in the labor market."" As mega-cap tech stocks gain and September's interest rate cut sent markets higher, Raymond James Investment Management chief market strategist Matt Orton still likes the Big Tech sector: “There's plenty of reasons that clients still want to own the mega-cap technology names. Especially the high-quality ones that are generating $50 [billion], $60 [billion], $70 billion of free cash flow per year. But what I've been encouraging clients really for the past three months or so is that we have an opportunity to build better balance in our portfolios.” Shares of Nike (NKE) are rallying after the company announced that CEO John Donahoe will be stepping down next month after a rocky five years at the company. Nike veteran Elliott Hill will come out of retirement to fill the role of CEO and president effective October 14. Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih believes that Hill will prioritize relationships with wholesale retail partners as he steps into the role: ""It's the base for kind of the brand strength going forward. And even though it's margin dilutive, when you're a $50 billion global footprint brand, you need both channels to be working in your favor."" She argues that Hill is the right person for the job, explaining that he's well-liked at the company, and before his retirement, his positions at Nike focused on the global marketplace. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 16 lineup is here and consumers are already coming in droves to get their hands on the new device. Yahoo Finance anchor Josh Lipton reports live from the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City where the new iPhones are already being sold, an occasion marked by CEO Tim Cook opening the doors to customers. Investors can brace for more volatility in Friday's trading session as more than $5 trillion in options are set to expire. The event, known on Wall Street as ""Triple Witching,"" sees contracts tied to individual stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds expire.

Tech stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points, with some of the Magnificent Seven names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge. Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss how to play the tech sector. “It's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,” Chronert says. “The leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600."" “Essentially what you have here… is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.” Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citi’s view on the group: “We've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.” He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — who control over 6% of the index — ""those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today. But, what we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now. It's beginning to decelerate.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

2024-09-12 14:30:45,"How Oracle is giving Nvidia, other chip stocks a boost. Semiconductor stocks rallied in Wednesday's trading session after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang highlighted ""great"" demand for AI chips. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates ""a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings."" While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: ""I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet."" He argues that Oracle is ""one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward."" He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the ""expansive market"" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a ""proxy for Apple (AAPL),"" noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be ""unabated"" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, ""What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x."" ""So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here,"" he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Neuberger Berman senior research analyst Dan Flax joined Market Domination anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on the Yahoo Finance Playbook to discuss navigating recent sluggishness in some tech stocks. Apple (AAPL) demonstrated that it ""can continue to innovate"" at Monday's event, Flax said, noting that ""the user experience is continuing to change"" while ""the developer community remains healthy."" The analyst said he expects ""better growth over the next year, which will contribute to stock price outperformance."" Flax said that Nvidia (NVDA) stands to gain as cloud vendors like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) invest in artificial intelligence (AI) despite near-term volatility amid Blackwell delays. He says the key for Nvidia ""is to continue to execute on its product cycles."" After Oracle (ORCL) stock jumped following its first quarter earnings beat, Flax noted positive feedback from Oracle's cloud customers. The analyst expects ""growth for Oracle cloud to remain robust over the next few years"" though ""it's certainly lumpy quarter to quarter.""

2024-09-10 21:50:56,"Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney: What's next for the stocks?. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Catalysts Host Madison Mills sit down with Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the state of media and tech companies, from Apple (AAPL) to Disney (DIS). On Monday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest product offerings at its highly anticipated ""It's Glowtime"" event in Cupertino, California. Ng explains that the event ""delivered in line with investor expectations,"" noting that historically, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 70 basis points on announcement days, and following the event, it underperformed by about 100 basis points. ""We think that was in line with historical events. And when you look at the individual product announcements, it came in mostly as expected,"" he adds. Ng reiterates his Buy rating on Apple, arguing that ""there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones."" He continues, ""We think that investors have historically thought about Apple iPhones at a normalized sell-through rate at about 225 to 230 million units. And we think that AI and some of the new product features that are going to get rolled out over the next few years is going to bring that normalized run rate closer to 250 to 260 million."" While there is debate among investors as to whether AI will be the demand driver for Apple, Ng is bullish on the technology. He also highlights that hardware changes will also drive an upgrade cycle as screen sizes increase, devices become thinner, and rumors that the iPhone 18 may potentially be foldable. Turning to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Ng believes that the company is managing its video business holistically. ""The linear TV network business is certainly having challenges. Cord cutting is unrelenting, and paid TV subscriber declines will continue to occur.

""I think there's a tremendous amount of focus on what that succession planning looks like. One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios, and obviously at ESPN,"" Ng tells Yahoo Finance.

Just after Apple (AAPL) unveiled the new iPhone 16 on Monday, Huawei Technologies, a Chinese phone maker, announced a new trifold device. Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan joined Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss how the new Huawei phone could affect competition in the China region.

""Apple will continue to take share in China in the long run,"" Mohan said.

While the new models boast improved battery life and camera capabilities, the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence features won't be immediately available when the iPhone 16 models are released on Friday, September 20. Interestingly, Carey suggests that this year's Apple event spotlight was on the Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods updates rather than the iPhone.

Ulanoff points out that Qualcomm-Google's focus on smart glasses rather than a headset could potentially yield better results.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) trimmed its stake in Apple (AAPL) by over 50% at the beginning of August. Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: ""Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there."" He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is ""finding places to play,"" but ultimately is ""waiting for better valuation."" Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Kevan Parekh, will assume the CFO role effective January 1, 2025. Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Morning Brief to discuss the implications of this change on the tech giant. Forte commends Maestri's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, expecting Parekh to continue this approach.

""These are challenging times for Apple on multiple fronts,"" Forte explains, citing increased regulation, EU scrutiny, and growing competition in China. Despite the succession, he expects ""the overall strategy to remain."" While acknowledging the significance of this leadership change, Forte believes ""the bigger question"" is when Apple will change its CEO.

CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Catalysts to share his outlook on the tech market. Zino notes that while tech has ""led the way"" in the market recovery, it remains ""the worst performing sector"" since July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino predicts ""more choppy action"" following this surge, expecting market volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period. He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 release. ""Those are the two product launches that we think could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates,"" Zino states.

Market volatility spurred by recession fears rocked the tech sector last week, causing large-cap names to come under pressure. Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the tech industry sa recession fears circulate. If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills dig into this week's market volatility, from jobless claims data to the yen carry trade unwinding. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, ""Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no."" The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. ""Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings,"" he explains. He adds, ""When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes."" A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, ""The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade."" Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, ""Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)."" He adds that ""Apple and Microsoft are going to be names that retail trades significantly anyways, but made up a larger percentage of trading on Monday and Tuesday, for sure, as people were looking for places to go buy.""

While some on Wall Street are concerned about a recession, wondering if the Federal Reserve waited too long to make cuts, others may seem this as a buying opportunity. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Market Domination to discuss the recent sell-off in tech and what investors need to know if they plan on buying the dip. Ives tells investors, ""For Big Tech, these are the buying opportunities... these global sort of white-knuckle moments, you buy high quality, large-cap tech"" Ives adds later, ""Look at the fundamentals. I mean, we just came through a tech earnings season that was actually pretty robust relative to, I think, Big Tech, cloud, and AI. Look at Palantir (PLTR) last night, just another, you know, monster performance. So we're kind of looking at what are the fundamentals look like.

On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the trading day's biggest stories, from the global market sell-off to some of the latest earnings reports. The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: ""Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong."" He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, ""the market is overreacting to just one data point."" Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company. Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, ""Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now."" For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to ""buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge."" A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote ""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly."" Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones. Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223.SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31.1 billion. Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions.

Big names in tech including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) will report their latest quarterly earnings this week. Investors will be watching the results closely following some mixed results from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL). Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Bryant VanCronkhite joins Wealth! to give insight into the upcoming tech earnings from Big Tech names and what investors should keep in mind moving forward. VanCronkhite explains that though the AI trade has fueled the market gains, right now, the developments aren't really showing up in quarterly results, leaving some investors questioning when it will happen. In terms of the tech sector, and the rotation into small caps that has been seen in markets the last few weeks, VanCronkhite states: ""I've been calling for this value rotation going back a couple of weeks now, and it's starting to play out well. There could be more legs to this, and it makes a lot of sense. With the amount of money being concentrated in a narrow market, we only get there for one of two reasons. We either get there because of greed or exuberance, which we have today around the AI trade, or you get there out of fear. When you're worried about the overall economy, maybe the Fed being late to react, pushing us into a recession, you want to get more and more capital around a fewer and fewer set of companies where you have the most visibility."" He continues with: ""So both fear and greed have pushed capital into a narrow market, but those will both get resolved eventually. And I think that the cool inflation prints is giving the market the belief the Fed can begin to act, giving them the chance to jump through that ever closing window to avoid a recession. And as that happens, the natural rotation is out of the concentrate names into the value trade into the broader markets.""

""The overall entertainment industry is large, it's a significant part of the global economy. And gaming is the biggest part of that — it's a $200 billion business today. It's bigger than streaming, bigger than the movie box office. Across the globe, 3 billion people play video games,"" former Nintendo (NTDOY) of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé explains to Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend. An industry veteran, Fils-Aimé held the positions of Nintendo of America president and COO from 2006 to 2019. He believes the gaming industry is ""poised for an upswing"" following post-pandemic contractions from game studios and consumers. Fils-Aimé weighs in on rising trends in gaming, including VR and AR headsets (virtual reality and augmented reality) — namely Apple's (AAPL) costly Vision Pro — and cloud gaming technology. Cloud gaming is ""just going to be another way that consumers can get access to games in the end, this is an industry that is driven by content,"" Fils-Aimé says, underlining the fact that it will ""always come down to the games"" no matter the platform or hardware behind it.

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, ""the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth."" He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have ""grown earnings when others have not."" He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, ""they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified."" He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, ""AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform.""

D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the tech giant's growth and what it means for its upcoming iPhone release cycle. AI integration will be a key component in the newest iPhones as Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI at its Worldwide Developers Conference. ""We haven't had a major iPhone upgrade cycle since iPhone 12. And now that there is a sense that there's enough new functionality and uses for the phone that we will have an upgrade cycle, which could last for a year or two. That warrants this excitement around the stock,"" Luria says. He believes that new Apple Intelligence features will compel consumers enough to drive a new device upgrade cycle. As Apple looks to diversify its exposure to global consumer markets, Luria believes India ""has a long-term promise,"" explaining: ""It's the country that's creating the most middle-class and upper-middle-class population anywhere around the world by far. It is in that sense the kind of driver that China was for the last 20 or 30 years. And so that's why it's a critically important market.""

2024-07-09 15:24:01,"2 reasons why investors are shorting Nvidia. As Nvidia (NVDA) continues to dominate the tech sector, it has become one of the most heavily shorted stocks. S3 Partners managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky joins Catalysts to discuss some of the biggest tech names eyed by short sellers. When it comes to Nvidia, Dusaniwsky explains that investors are shorting ""because it's an overheated stock."" While the run-up has been monumental, he notes that ""it's got to come back to Earth."" He also explains that some investors are shorting the stock ""because it's a hedge to the market. People are shorting Nvidia to hedge their entire portfolio and hedge their tech holdings. So you've got two different types of short selling going on in this name."" Dusaniwsky also points to Apple (AAPL) as a heavily shorted name, explaining that it's not fundamental investing: ""We're looking at a lot of traders that are looking at momentum and technical graphs and saying, 'Hey, I want to short this name. I want to go long this name'... More traders are going and looking at recent activity in the short side and kind of running along with that crowd or getting ahead of the crowd getting out of a name.""

As Americans kick off their holiday weekend, AAA Travel senior vice president Paula Twidale breaks down what Americans can expect from July Fourth travel. Twidale explains that American airports are gearing up for a record 70.9 million people traveling for the holiday, revealing that the pent-up pandemic-era travel demand isn't over: ""Consumers are not willing to give up the respite they deserve,"" she says. The Pacific Northwest, theme parks, and urban cities such as New York and Chicago are particularly popular domestic destinations, Twidale notes. However, she adds that international travel is equally high. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed at record highs in Tuesday's session. Jared Blikre breaks down his three biggest takeaways from the trading day: Tesla shares closing above $200, market concentration topping the 1929 peak, and the dip in stock volatility. Rising home prices and high mortgage rates are shutting out would-be US homebuyers. Angi co-founder Angie Hicks explains that Americans who would have thought about moving are now thinking about renovation. According to Angi's home spending reports, bathrooms are consistently in the top five renovation projects, while kitchens are in the top 10. Outdoor remodeling remains popular even in post-pandemic times, she adds. Seana Smith joins the show to analyze a new Wells Fargo chart showing the potential rebalancing of earnings growth in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Wells Fargo notes that earnings growth will broaden beyond the ""Magnificent 7,"" while participation and profitability outside of tech and communication services will also broaden.

2024-07-02 16:05:39,"Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie'. Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

On today's episode of Market Domination, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton discuss major market trends from Nvidia's (NVDA) slowdown to Novo Nordisk's (NVO) plans to expand manufacturing capabilities of its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. As Nvidia continues on its downward trajectory after leading the S&P 500's (^GSPC) growth, B. Riley Wealth Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan believes the market can keep up its momentum without the chip giant: ""I think it's a perfect example of a lot of folks being concerned that Nvidia and arguably Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) were such a big part of the 15% that the S&P 500 is higher this year on a year to date basis... But you're seeing basically three or four days where Nvidia has not been leading the charge, and the market's done very well. I think that continues throughout the second half of this year."" The European Union has charged Apple under its Digital Markets Act, alleging that the tech giant's App Store practices prevent app developers from directing consumers to cheaper services. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell believes the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon, and that Apple will have to make some changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place. And therefore, long term, I don't think the impact is that big of a deal as far as the value of the company and the way people view the stock."" Cryptocurrencies are also under pressure, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst trading day since March. Meanwhile, the health industry is making major moves, as Altimmune (ALT) reported positive results in Phase 2 trials for its weight-loss drug, a Teladoc Health (TDOC) study showed its AI models contributed to positive growth in diabetes management, and Novo Nordisk revealed plans to invest $4.1 billion in building out a manufacturing facility in Clayton, North Carolina for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

2024-06-24 20:20:52,"Apple stock will see little impact from EU probe: Analyst. The European Union has charged Apple (AAPL) under its Digital Markets Act, which could result in serious fines. The bloc alleges that the tech giant's App Store practices prevent app developers from directing consumers to cheaper services. TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Market Domination to give insight into Apple's dealings with the EU's regulatory body and its investments in artificial intelligence. O'Donnell explains that the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon: ""There's no official word on part of this until March of 2025, so nothing right away,"" the chief analyst says. He argues that any stock reaction to the news may be premature, particularly given Apple's incentives to make changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place. And therefore, long term, I don't think the impact is that big of a deal as far as the value of the company and the way people view the stock.""
